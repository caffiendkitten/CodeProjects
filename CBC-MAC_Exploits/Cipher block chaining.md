CBC (Cipher block chaining) is an encryption mode in which the message is split into blocks of X bytes length and each block is encrypted separately using a key.

To do:
 - Create a user with a username similar to the desired username.
 - Modify the first bytes of the cookie to become the username you are trying to become.

__Note:__ Keep in mind that not all CBC implementation will give you access to the IV. In some cases, the IV will be hardcoded. 

The Attack:
After decoding the cookie, you can then extract the IV, and brute-force the byte (first byte of the IV if you used a username like bdmin or xdmin) you need to change until you become admin. This will allow you to only have to tamper with the first byte to become admin.

You can also perform the same attack without using brute force by computing what the XOR between the first letter of the username you want and the first letter of the username you use and apply this (XOR) to the first byte of the IV.

To Attack:
Once registered as bdmin you get the cookie... url decode it, base64 decode it, look at the first byte value

run irb
2.6.1 :001 > 0x55^'a'.ord^'b'.ord
 => 86 
2.6.1 :002 > "%2x" % 86
 => "56" 


'a' is the byte we want 
'b' is the byte we registered as

Once the difference is noticed you can pase in the new cookie and refresh the page OR just change the different characters in the cookie and refresh the page to get the cookie to thing you are admin.
